## ðŸ”¹ HTTP Key Concepts
It is a client/server system. It is stateless.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Takeaways:**
- HTTP is a client/server system.
- HTTP is stateless = does keep track of operations; only processes requests and has recollection of previous requests
- Client = broswer
- Server = web server
- `HTTP Messages` allow a client to communicate requests to a server to retrieve resources from it.
- Two types of `HTTP Messages`: Request and Response messages
- The format of any of the two types of `HTTP Messages` is the same and as follows:
Start line, headers, and body (optional)
- `start line` defines what resource is in question
- `headers` are modifications to the `HTTP Message` like what language is being used, or what format is the resource to be delivered in.
- `body` is optional and is the data that is needed to accomplish the overall messsage
- The `HTTP method or verb` defines what do with the resource 
- The `HTTP verb` is found in the `start line`
- `HTTP Response Message` will contain the result code. 200 is ok, 404 means not exist
- The `result code` is found in the `start line` in a `Reponse message`
- The resource requested is found in the `body` of a `Reponse message`
- there are 4 `HTTP verbs`: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- The `POST, PUT, DELETE HTTP verbs` make this client/server system `stateful` by allowing `HTTP Requests` to change the state of data of an app
