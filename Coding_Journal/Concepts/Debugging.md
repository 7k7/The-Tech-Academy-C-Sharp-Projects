# Debugging

**Overview**
Figuring what went wrong and where using VS for debugging code.

---
## 🔹 Debugging with VS
Put break points which is stop during execution to see it step by step.
Click on the side gray column of the line of the code which genreate a red dot.
Execution stops at the code line with the break point. That line is not yet executed.
Step over means execute current line and move one step/line over.
Step into means go through every step in detail of implementing the current line.
To fast forward through a loop, place a break point on the follwoing line out of it,
then press continue.
Remove all breakpoint with crtl + shift + f9
:

👨‍💻 **Code Example:**
```csharp
// Add all relevant C# code example here.
```

📌 **Key Takeaways:**
- To debug is to figure what and where is the bug.
- Adding breakpoints stop program execution at the line it is on.
- Step over executes current line stopped on then moves to the next in the same code file
- Step into executes current line and goes through each line of executing it.
- To fast forward through a loop, set a breakpoint out of loop then press continue
