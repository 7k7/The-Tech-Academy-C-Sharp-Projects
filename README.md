 This repo contains some of my small projects that I created using C# and the .NET Framework.
## Projects:

- [Car Insurance](https://github.com/7k7/The-Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Coding_Journal/Projects/CarInsurance)
- [Student Roster](https://github.com/7k7/The-Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Coding_Journal/Projects/StudentDBApp)

### Car Insurance
This is an MVC web application that provides users insurance quotes like a car insurance website.
Users are provided with an insurance quote based on business logic by receiving user's input on polcy information. 
Staff users are provided an admin page to view all quotes this web app has created and stored.

### Student Roster
This is a data visualization console application that stores student data in a database(basic personal student information).
It utilizes the Entity Framework 6 for data access and a Code First workflow. It is still a work in progress.
